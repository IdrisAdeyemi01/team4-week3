                 Whether its copywriting a document, or publishing a 
                document, without the rightful owner's consent is Plagiarism. 
                Its a dime a dozen these days, that most people steal other's 
                content without permission, taking all the credits as well, 
                due to the fact that, they couldn't come up with their own ideas 
                and resort to publishing a document or an article written by another 
                person, a common reason for this, is to beat deadlines or avoid excess 
                workload. With our online Check-it-out Plagiarism app, you have zero 
                worries knowing if a document, proposal, or even an article is plagiarized.
